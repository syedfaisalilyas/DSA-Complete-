## Title
Airline Ticket Booking Management System

## Description
The Airline Ticket Booking Management System uses smart ways to make booking flights easier. It organizes information efficiently using csv file, helping users quickly find available flights (searching through tress (BST, AVL, RB)), choose the best routes using graphs, and book tickets securely while implementing linked list. With a simple interface (UI through QT designer), travelers can easily check real-time flight details and prices, making the whole process smooth.
